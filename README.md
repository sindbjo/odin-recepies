# odin-recepies
Follow TOP, be great developer
I will test my ability to create a simple website for recipes. 
I am discovering that my project name has a typo (odin-recepies). I will try to change it, but i do not know if pushing the project with a new name changes it in github or breakes it. Lets find out.
